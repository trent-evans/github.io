I'm a pretty baisc dude.  I go to school, I work, I run, and I play video games.
<p>
I study <a href="https://msd.utah.edu">Software Development</a> in the <a href="www.cs.utah.edu">School of Computing</a> at the <a href="www.utah.edu"> University of Utah</a>.
<br> So far I've really enjoyed the program! I mean, I made this website for a homework assignment.  So, that's pretty cool, right?

<h2>Master of Software Development</h2>

<hr>
<p>
As I mentioned above, I'm studying Software Development at the University of Utah.  Specifically, I'm in the <b>Master of Software Development</b> program, a program that was launched two years ago as a way to introduce more software developers and engineers into the job market in Utah.  I'm part of the 3rd cohort of students to enter the program. The program is specifically geared towards those with little to no background in computer science, so we have a very diverse group.
</p><p>
If you're curious to see some cool things I've done in the course, you can check out my <a href="https://github.com/trent-evans/portfolio">portfolio</a>. (It's empty right now, but I'm going to put a few things in it soon)
</p><p>
Long term, I'd like to get into software development geared towards medical device design.  My undergraduate degree is in <a href="https://www.bme.utah.edu"><b>Biomedical Engineering</b></a> which is what drives me to apply the things I'm learning in software development to help build up better and more customized medical devices and interfaces to help with patient needs around the globe.
</p><p>
I'm also very interested in studying more about <a href="https://medicine.utah.edu/dbmi/">Biomedical Informatics</a> and I'm considering pursuing their graduate certificate after I earn my MSD.

<h3>Heaven on Earth - A Little About What I Love</h3>

<hr>
One of my favorite places in the world is Lake Tahoe.  I've been there twice and been absolutely <i>captivated</i> by the stunning scenery.  Both times I was at Tahoe for Spartan Race World Championships. Suffice it to say that between the race and the natural beauty around me, I definitely had my breath taken away.

A dream vacation of mine would to be able to spend a week at Lake Tahoe running and hiking all over the trails and spending time enjoying all the nature that is out there.
